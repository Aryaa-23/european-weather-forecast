COMPLETE SETUP INSTRUCTIONS FOR YOUR PC:

PROBLEM: You're missing all the application code files (React frontend, Express backend, etc.)

EASY SOLUTION:

1. Go to this Replit project: https://replit.com/@your-replit-username/your-project-name

2. Click the "Download" button (usually in the top menu) to download the complete project as a ZIP file

3. Extract the ZIP file to your computer

4. Open Command Prompt in the extracted folder

5. Run these commands:
   npm install
   npx tsx server/index.ts

6. Open browser to: http://localhost:5000

ALTERNATIVE MANUAL SOLUTION:

If you can't download from Replit, I can create all the files manually, but you'll need about 40+ files including:

- All React components and pages
- Express server code  
- UI component library (30+ files)
- Configuration files
- Styling files

Would you prefer to:
A) Download the complete ZIP from Replit (recommended)
B) Have me create all files manually (will take longer)

The ZIP download is much faster and ensures you get all files correctly.
